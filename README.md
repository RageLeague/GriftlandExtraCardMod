# GriftlandExtraCardMod

A mod for Griftlands. Adds some cards with interesting concepts to the game.

It will be constantly updated.

## Install

1. Find "Griftlands" folder on your computer, where you installed it.
2. Open data.zip with WinRAR. Go to "data.zip\scripts\content\negotiation". Drag sal_negotiation_mod.lua into this folder.
3. Volia! It probably works. Then you can run "Griftlands" and see the changes. If everything works, you can go to the compedium section and see the new cards.

## What changes are added to the game?

* New cards! They don't have amazing art, because I just used the art from other cards in the game already.
* New cards will show up in Sal's campaign. I haven't figured out how to make it work for Rook as well.
* That's about it.

## Supported versions

This mod works for Griftlands Alpha(Update 10) and Griftlands Experimental, probably. I won't guarentee it works for future versions of the game.
