# Changelog

## 0.1.0

* Update mod installation process since there's official mod support now.
* Added a new battle card: **Ailment Storm**.
* Seperate the unlock packs into two since the screen can't fit them all together.
* Actually made the unlock packs work for each character. For example, **Bloodletting** won't show up in Rook's pack because Rook can't use it.

## 0.0.4 (Mar 25, 2020)

* Streamlined mod installation process a bit.
* Added an erratum for **Stagger** so it's a debuff.
* Errata'd **Vendetta** so that it doesn't crash when refered to in a card during battle.
* Buffed **Bloodletting**: Deal additional 3~5 damage and change **Wide Bloodletting** to **Crippling Bloodletting**.
* Added 2 new battle cards: **Bullseye** and **Provoking Kick**.
* Added 2 new negotiation cards: **Clairvoyance** and **Surprise information**.
* Changed the series for **Bloodletting** because Rook can't really use it.

## 0.0.3 (Mar 23, 2020)

* Added 3 new battle cards: **Bloodletting**, **Bodyguard**, and **Critical Strike**.
* Added a unlock pack to the mod so it can be enabled and disabled in game. Comes after the 10th pack in each character.
* Buffed **Preach**: 3 -> 4 **indoctrination** for unupgraded card, and 5 -> 6 for enhanaced card.

## 0.0.2 (Mar 21, 2020)

* Change the card set to neutral so it works with Rook(Probably).
* Change **Blackmail** to common from uncommon.
